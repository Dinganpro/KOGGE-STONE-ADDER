## ðŸ’¡ Description
The Kogge-Stone Adder is an advanced parallel-prefix form of carry-lookahead adder used for high-speed arithmetic operations. This project documents the RTL design, verification, and ASIC synthesis reports.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Synopsys Design Compiler
- ModelSim
- Vivado (for visualization)

## ðŸ”¬ Project Highlights
- Fully pipelined 4-bit adder
- Verified using waveform analysis
- Area and power-optimized design
